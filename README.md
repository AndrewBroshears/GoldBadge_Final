# GoldBadge_Final
Challenge 1: Komodo Cafe
In this challenge I created a menu for the resturant which I thought was fairly simple. Was able to knock this challenge out in about 2 days.
This challenge applied a lot of what we learned during the repository design portion of class and I was able to use a lot of reference material.

Challenge 2: Komodo Claims Department
In this challenge I created an application that would utilize a Queue for claims. This challenge was more difficult than the first specifically using the Queue.
Once I did some research and using references from previous assignments I was able to complete this challenge after several days. Unit testing is noticably 
lacking due to inexperience.

Challenge 3: Komodo Insurance: Badges
This was by far the most difficult challenge for me to complete and you will notice there are still several bugs/holes. I needed to create an application
that would take a dictionary of doors assigned to badges and apply CRUD methods. I still don't think I fully understand Dictionaries and how to use them 
even after a few days of research. After several attempts I was able to get a working console app but many of methods are flawed. Ran into several conversion
issues that limited the amount of completion time I had available. Didn't even attempt unit testing.

GitHub Issues:
A few things to note for GitHub utilization:
-Overall organization is a must. I messed up folder paths, added too many folders, didnt save and had to recover and continueing with additional problems
-Pushing still seems to be a issue especially with merge conflicts. Learned Force Push.
-Remember to save!!!

Note***
I would still like to revist these apps in the future to complete their intented purposes and apply better techniques. Many many hours went into these challenges
and I continue to have a new found respect the complexity of C# and a determination to master it.
